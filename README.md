# Apriori Algorithm (Java)
An implementation of the Apriori algorithm in Java.
This algorithm tells you which kind of combination appears most often in a data set. 
This implementation takes the data set 'adult.txt' and concludes in the 7th iteration that the combination [Husband, White, United-States, Male, <=50K, Private, Married-civ-spouse] appears 3831 times (most often combination with 6 items). <br>
You can find out more about this algorithm <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/apriori-algorithm/">here</a>.
